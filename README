The program I created is a library application that allows the end user to use collections to store and manage complex data,
books in this instance, and utilizes file persistence to save and load data between application runtime sessions.
It is based on a CRUD application system as it allows users to do the basic applications of crud.
More specifically, my application allows users to select an option from Create / List / Search / Update / Delete / Exit
in order to manage the books in the "resources.json" file
